# Sample Files Generator
Bash script to create sample files for Linux environments.

Created to help me in my project [Boston Icons](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1012402/).


### How to use

* To give permissions: `chmod +x ./samples.sh`

* Run with: `./samples.sh`

* Double click can run it without command prompt, but this method doesn't show any message.
